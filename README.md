A simple game using five dices. Made using Visual Basic.

The rules are simple:

- Press the big button to roll the dices. The numbers will show up in the boxes above.
- You can then choose if you want to keep the numbers or not by pressing the buttons below the boxes.
- Press the big button to re-roll unkept dices. You can re-roll up to 2 times per round.
- Once you either can't roll anymore or decide to keep all numbers, click an empty box to the right corresponding to the
  the type of roll you have. You have to choose a box every round.
- You get points depending on what you chose and if your dices match the chosen name.
  If nothing matches, you can also choose a box not matching your dices. This will fill it with a 0,
  disabling it.
- Repeat this until all boxes are filled and your final score will be shown.
